Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.

One reason for this is that they help us build upon the combined experience of many developers that came before us and ensure we structure our code in an optimized way, meeting the needs of problems we're attempting to solve.

Design patterns also provide us a common vocabulary to describe solutions. This can be significantly simpler than describing syntax and semantics when we're attempting to convey a way of structuring a solution in code form to others.

Over the past couple of years, the web development ecosystem has changed rapidly. Whereas some well-known design patterns may simply not be as valuable as they used to be, others have evolved to solve modern problems with the latest technologies.
